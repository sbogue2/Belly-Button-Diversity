# Belly-Button-Diversity
## Purpose

The goal of this exercise is to create a convenient dashboard that will display the bacterial data for each volunteer. The dashboard displays the demographic information, a horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 bacterial cultures found, a gauge chart displaying belly button washing frequency, and a bubble chart displaying the bacterial cultures per sample for each volunteer that is selected via a drop down menu. 

## Results

Below are several screenshots showing the website in action:

This shows the top portion of the website, including the header, the bar chart, and the gauge chart.
